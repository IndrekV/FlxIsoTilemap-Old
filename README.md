FlxIsoTilemap
==========

Isometric tilemap implementation for HaxeFlixel.

This project is based on the great work done by [Masadow](https://github.com/Masadow) and [Tiago-Ling](https://github.com/Tiago-Ling)

Original project is visible at https://github.com/Masadow/FlxTilemap

### Current status / features

Currently in alpha, not recommended for production environments. Big refactoring / breaking changes are very likely to happen!

 * Map culling, supports map sizes of up to 1000x1000 with constant draw time (maps can be bigger in theory but beware of memory consumption)
 * Sprite and dynamic tile sorting, allowing moving objects to appear behind or in front of walls, doors, etc
 * Pathfinding with simple A* implementation
 * Map scrolling and zoom
 
### Live Demo

 * [Flash](http://tiagoling.com/uploads/iso_tilemap/flash/index.html)
 * [HTML5](http://tiagoling.com/uploads/iso_tilemap/html5/index.html)
 
### To do:

 * Heights
 * Slopes
 * Bridges
 * Bigger-than-tile objects
 * Improve performance
 * Better demo
 * Link to Neko & Cpp Binaries

### Known Bugs

 * Sometimes when scrolling the leftmost column on the screen appears / disappears (floating point maybe?);
 * Tilemap tearing in Flash (very easy to spot when scrolling the camera, some tiles will be drawn 1px off their position) - might be on flixel side;
 * Collisions not working correctly (callbacks dispatching regardless of position and tile type);
 * Zoom not working correctly in html5

### Targets

 * [x] Flash
 * [x] Html5 (using Openfl default backend)
 * [x] Desktop (cpp & neko)
 * [x] Android
 * [ ] iOS (should work, test needed)

### Misc
 
 * The images `char.png` and `char_64.png` is originally from (http://opengameart.org), i downloaded it a long time ago and i couldn't find the original author anymore.
